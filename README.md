# Order_Invariant_Sequence_LSTM

## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to perform meaningful calculations on a sequence of data using Long Short Term Memory. This program particularly takes in sets of 10 images that contain hand written digits and tries to count how many of each digit there are. This is a variation on a simple classification problem. This code is a simple implementation of the paper ORDERMATTERS: SEQUENCE TO SEQUENCE FOR SETS (Vinyals et al., 2015b).

## Running Program
Enter the comman "python3 main.py" in your favorite terminal while in this directory.
